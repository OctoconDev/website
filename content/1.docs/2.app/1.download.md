The Octocon app is currently available for Android, with an iOS release planned for some time between 
late 2024 and early 2025. You can download it from the respective app stores:

## Registering an account

To use the Octocon app, you will need to register an account using either Google or Discord. Octocon does **not**
store any credentials like passwords; it exclusively uses these third-party services for authentication for your
security and privacy.

If you previously registered an account using the Octocon Discord bot, you can log in with that same Discord
account in the app to access your data. If you would like to link your Google account to your existing account,
you can do this by logging in with Discord **first** and then linking your Google account in the app's settings.
